# ESLint Configuration Project Status

## Completed Tasks

All initial ESLint setup tasks have been completed:

1. ✅ Installed ESLint 9 and TypeScript-ESLint dependencies
2. ✅ Installed Effect-TS ESLint plugin
3. ✅ Created eslint.config.mjs with flat config format
4. ✅ Added lint scripts to package.json
5. ✅ Tested ESLint configuration on existing code

## Current State

- ESLint 9 is configured using the new flat config format in `eslint.config.mjs`
- Configuration includes TypeScript support and Effect-TS specific rules
- Lint scripts are available in package.json: `bun run lint` and `bun run lint:fix`
- Configuration has been tested and is working properly

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added ESLint dependencies and lint scripts
- `eslint.config.mjs` - New ESLint configuration file (created)
- `bun.lock` - Updated with new dependencies

## Next Steps

The ESLint setup is complete and ready for use. No immediate follow-up tasks are required unless specific linting rules need to be adjusted or additional plugins need to be added.
