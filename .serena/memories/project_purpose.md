# Project Purpose

This is an Effect-TS application built with Bun runtime. The project demonstrates a basic Effect-TS program that:

- Loads configuration from environment variables (HOST and PORT)
- Uses Effect's functional programming paradigm for program composition
- Runs on Bun runtime with BunContext for platform integration

The main application reads HOST and PORT configuration values and logs a startup message. It's a foundational setup for building more complex Effect-TS applications with Bun.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Runtime**: Bun (v1.2.17+)
- **Framework**: Effect-TS (functional programming framework)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Platform**: @effect/platform-bun for Bun integration
